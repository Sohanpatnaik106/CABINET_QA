# üî• Updates

- [**2022-04-19**]: TAPEX is officially supported by ü§ó transformers! Now you can find the [example fine-tuning script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/tapex) and the [tapex model](https://huggingface.co/models?search=microsoft/tapex) on the huggingface master branch. Have fun!
- [**2022-03-09**]: We have fixed the issue in `tapex-large`! Now you can view [here](#-run-tapex-using-huggingface) to see how to fine-tune TAPEX using ü§ó transformers and ü§ó datasets! They will be merged into the main library soon!
- [**2022-02-20**]: Our paper is accepted by ICLR 2022! We also provided a fine-tuning script based on ü§ó transformers, which is not merged now. You can see the preview version [here](https://github.com/SivilTaram/transformers/tree/add_tapex_bis/examples/research_projects/tapex). ‚ö†Ô∏è It is worth noting that `tapex-large` is not well-prepared now. We found there is a strange bug in `bart-large`, which also affects `tapex-large`. Hope it is solved in the near future.

# üè¥Û†Å∂Û†ÅµÛ†Å≠Û†Å°Û†Å∞Û†Åø Overview

In the paper, we present T<span class="span-small">A</span>PE<span class="span-small">X</span> (for **Ta**ble **P**re-training via **Ex**ecution), a conceptually simple and empirically powerful pre-training approach to empower existing generative pre-trained models (e.g., [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) in our paper) with table reasoning skills.
T<span class="span-small">A</span>PE<span class="span-small">X</span> realizes table pre-training by **learning a neural SQL executor over a synthetic corpus**, which is obtained by automatically synthesizing executable SQL queries.

<figure style="text-align:center">

  <figcaption>Fig 1. The schematic illustration of T<span class="span-small">A</span>PE<span class="span-small">X</span>. Tables not shown for brevity.</figcaption>
</figure>


The central point of T<span class="span-small">A</span>PE<span class="span-small">X</span> is to train a model to **mimic the SQL query execution process over a table**.
We believe that if a model can be trained to faithfully *execute* SQL queries, then it must have a deep understanding of table structures and possess an inductive bias towards table structures.

Meanwhile, since the diversity of SQL queries can be guaranteed systemically, and thus a *diverse* and *high-quality* pre-training corpus can be automatically synthesized for T<span class="span-small">A</span>PE<span class="span-small">X</span>.

## Project

This project contains two parts, `tapex` library and `examples` to employ it on different table-related applications (e.g., Table Question Answering).

- For `tapex`, there is an overview:

```shell
|-- common
    |-- dbengine.py # the database engine to return answer for a SQL query
    |-- download.py # download helper for automatic resource
|-- data_utils
    |-- wikisql
        |-- executor.py # the re-implementation of WikiSQL style SQL execution to obtain ground-truth answers in the dataset
    |-- format_converter.py # convert dataset formats into HuggingFace style
    |-- preprocess_binary.py # wrapper for the fairseq preprocess script
    |-- preprocess_bpe.py # wrapper for the BPE preprocess
|-- processor
    |-- table_linearize.py # the class to flatten a table into a linearized form, which should keep consistent during pre-training, fine-tuning and evaluating
    |-- table_truncate.py # the class to truncate a long table into a shorter version to satisfy model's input length limit (e.g., BART can accept at most 1024 tokens)
    |-- table_processor.py # the wrapper for the above two table utility function classes
|-- model_eval.py # evaluate the denotation accuracy of model
|-- model_interface.py # wrap a model interface for interaction based on HubInterface
```

- For `examples`, please refer to [here](examples) for more details.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

## Prepare Environment

First, you should set up a python environment. This code base has been tested under python 3.x, and we officially support python 3.8.

After installing python 3.8, we strongly recommend you to use `virtualenv` (a tool to create isolated Python environments) to manage the python environment. You could use following commands to create an environment `venv` and activate it.

```bash
$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install TAPEX

The main requirements of our code base is [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq), which may be difficult for beginners to get started in an hour.

However, do not worry, we already wrap all necessary commands for developers.
In other words, you do not need to study fairseq to start your journey about TAPEX!
You can simply run the following command (in the virtual environment) to use TAPEX:

```bash
$ pip install --editable ./
```

> The argument `--editable` is important for your potential follow-up modification on the tapex library. The command will not only install dependencies, but also install `tapex` as a library, which can be imported easily.

## Use TAPEX

Once `tapex` is successfully installed, you could go into [examples](examples) to enjoy fine-tuning TAPEX models and using them on different applications!

# üè∞ Resource

## Pre-training Corpus

Our synthetic pre-training corpus which includes nearly **5,000,000** tuples of (*SQL queries*, *flattened tables*, *SQL execution results*) can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/pretraining-corpus/tapex_pretrain.tar.gz). You can use it for research purpose, but you should be careful about the [data license](LICENSE-Data).

Below is an example from the pre-training corpus:

- The SQL plus flattened Table as **INPUT**:
```
select ( select number where number = 4 ) - ( select number where number = 3 ) col : number | date | name | age (at execution) | age (at offense) | race | state | method row 1 : 1 | november 2, 1984 | velma margie barfield | 52 | 45 | white | north carolina | lethal injection row 2 : 2 | february 3, 1998 | karla faye tucker | 38 | 23 | white | texas | lethal injection row 3 : 3 | march 30, 1998 | judias v. buenoano | 54 | 28 | white | florida | electrocution row 4 : 4 | february 24, 2000 | betty lou beets | 62 | 46 | white | texas | lethal injection row 5 : 5 | may 2, 2000 | christina marie riggs | 28 | 26 | white | arkansas | lethal injection row 6 : 6 | january 11, 2001 | wanda jean allen | 41 | 29 | black | oklahoma | lethal injection row 7 : 7 | may 1, 2001 | marilyn kay plantz | 40 | 27 | white | oklahoma | lethal injection row 8 : 8 | december 4, 2001 | lois nadean smith | 61 | 41 | white | oklahoma | lethal injection row 9 : 9 | may 10, 2002 | lynda lyon block | 54 | 45 | white | alabama | electrocution row 10 : 10 | october 9, 2002 | aileen carol wuornos | 46 | 33 | white | florida | lethal injection row 11 : 11 | september 14, 2005 | frances elaine newton | 40 | 21 | black | texas | lethal injection row 12 : 12 | september 23, 2010 | teresa wilson bean lewis | 41 | 33 | white | virginia | lethal injection row 13 : 13 | june 26, 2013 | kimberly lagayle mccarthy | 52 | 36 | black | texas | lethal injection row 14 : 14 | february 5, 2014 | suzanne margaret basso | 59 | 44 | white | texas | lethal injection
```
- The SQL Execution Result as **OUTPUT**:
```
1.0
```

Here we want to acknowledge the huge effort of paper [On the Potential of Lexico-logical Alignments for Semantic Parsing to SQL Queries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11246.pdf), which provides the rich resources of SQL templates for us to synthesize the pre-training corpus.
If you are interested, please give a STAR to their [repo](https://github.com/tzshi/squall).

## Pre-trained models

The pre-trained models trained on the above pre-training corpus.

Model | Description | # Params | Download
---|---|---|---
`tapex.base` | 6 encoder and decoder layers | 140M | [tapex.base.tar.gz](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/pretrained-model/tapex.base.tar.gz)
`tapex.large` | 12 encoder and decoder layers | 400M | [tapex.large.tar.gz](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/pretrained-model/tapex.large.tar.gz)

## Fine-tuned Models

We provide fine-tuned model weights and their performance on different datasets below. The following Accuracy (Acc) refers to denotation accuracy computed by our script `model_eval.py`. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that we need truncating long tables during preprocessing with some randomness. Therefore, we also provide preprocessed datasets for reproducing our experimental results.

Model | Dev Acc | Test Acc | Dataset | Download Data | Download Model
---|---|----|----|----|----
`tapex.large.wtq` | 58.0 | 57.2 | WikiTableQuestions | [wtq.preprocessed.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/preprocessed-data/wtq.preprocessed.zip) | [tapex.large.wtq.tar.gz](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/fine-tuned-model/tapex.large.wtq.tar.gz)
`tapex.large.sqa` | 70.7 | 74.0 | SQA | [sqa.preprocessed.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/preprocessed-data/sqa.preprocessed.zip) | [tapex.large.sqa.tar.gz](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/fine-tuned-model/tapex.large.sqa.tar.gz)
`tapex.large.wikisql` | 89.3 | 89.2 | WikiSQL | [wikisql.preprocessed.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/preprocessed-data/wikisql.preprocessed.zip) | [tapex.large.wikisql.tar.gz](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/fine-tuned-model/tapex.large.wikisql.tar.gz)
`tapex.large.tabfact` | 84.2 | 84.0 | TabFact | [tabfact.preprocessed.zip](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/preprocessed-data/tabfact.preprocessed.zip) | [tapex.large.tabfact.tar.gz](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining/releases/download/fine-tuned-model/tapex.large.tabfact.tar.gz)

Given these fine-tuned model weights, you can play with them using the `predict` mode in `examples/tableqa/run_model.py`.

For example, you can use the following command and see its log:
```shell
$ python examples/tableqa/run_model.py predict --resource-dir ./tapex.large.wtq --checkpoint-name model.pt
2021-08-29 17:39:47 | INFO | __main__ | Receive question as : Greece held its last Summer Olympics in which year?
2021-08-29 17:39:47 | INFO | __main__ | The answer should be : 2004
```

# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'bpe'

You should firstly check the version of fairseq, which should be `1.0.0a0+801a646` when you use `pip list` to show it.

Note that the fairseq dependency is not officially released as `1.0.0`, so the one is not correct if you directly install it from `pip install fairseq`. Our installtion is equalivant to the following command:
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.git@801a64683164680562c77b688d9ca77fc3e0cea7
```
It also requires you to have `Git` installed at first.
